Your course content

What you will learn

Our degree programme International Business in Germany offers not only the content comparable to the German bachelor programme but on top provides you with intercultural competences, and precious experiences abroad: Your semester abroad will not only boost your foreign language(s) – for many students it is an experience echoing throughout their whole life. At times, important networks and contacts are built which are valuable for your future career. The integrated semester abroad at one of our partnering universities also offers you a very wide range of interesting topics to specialize in the academic area of your interest.

Your course content in detail

Nowadays, an international and border-crossing mindset already constitutes an important qualification in its own right, and is highly valued in the job market. Students who understand different cultures, have a more inclusive mindset, and are aware of diverse business practices are highly sought-after. Our International Business Bachelor's degree program supports this by offering modules such as, for example
