Your course content

##  What you will learn

The Master’s programme in Global Business and Leadership will enable you to
gain the key transferable skills required in the labour market, allowing you
to act independently and successfully: from the theoretical foundations of
international management, leadership, strategic management and social research
(market research) to leading intercultural teams. Last but not least, you will
have the opportunity to apply all the skills gained during our
teaching/learning events and in exchange with our practice partners. You will
learn the foundations of strategic management, get an in-depth understanding
about leadership (including psychological aspects) and social research (market
research), and apply this theory to practical problems.

Your career prospects

##  Our innovative approach that pays off

With a clear focus on leadership and management functions in companies, and
against the backdrop of increasing labour mobility, completing this programme
is the perfect way to start your career in a globalised world. Launch your
career in Germany, Europe or on another continent: your management skills and
the experience gained with your fellow students from all over the world will
put you one step ahead of other applicants. If you are keen to implement your
business model after graduation, our Founder Institute will support you.

> What I like most is being able to work with people from different careers
> and nationalities. The courses are challenging, interactive and related to
> recent topics. The staff is always ready to help us and tries to create an
> enjoyable environment.

Dual Degree Programmes

Dual Degree Programmes

##  THINK BIG – two degrees, two universities, two countries

Two degrees mean greater career opportunities, a potentially higher starting
salary, and a wider set of skills that will be highly sought after in the
labour market. Taking a dual degree programme means that you will be studying
at SRH University Heidelberg and at one of our partner universities abroad.
Dual degree graduates receive two academic degrees – one degree from each
country.
